This is a sample document that demonstrates how the AI Assistant can reference external information.

You can replace this with your own documents such as:
- Product information
- FAQ content
- Educational materials
- Research data
- Company policies

Any text, PDF, or Word documents placed in the documents folder will be read by the assistant and used to inform its responses.
